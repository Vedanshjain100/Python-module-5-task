Assignment 5 – Data Structures and Strings in Python

This repository contains two Python programs created for practicing basic data structures and string handling in Python.

The programs focus on working with dictionaries, lists, user input, and slicing operations.

Task 1 – Student Marks Dictionary

This program creates a dictionary where student names are stored as keys and their marks are stored as values.

The user is asked to enter a student name.  
If the name exists in the dictionary, the program displays the marks.  
If the name is not found, the program displays an appropriate message.

This task helps in understanding dictionary access and basic error handling.

Task 2 – List Slicing

This program creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

The first five elements are extracted from the list.  
The extracted elements are then reversed.  
Both the extracted list and the reversed list are displayed.

This task helps in understanding list slicing and list manipulation.
